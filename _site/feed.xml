This metric is quantified by the UK Office of National Statistics by the ‘Index of Multiple Deprivation’, a combined measure of several factors for a particular area considering things like available of housing, crime, barriers to housing and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus statistics for UK nations are provided by the UK government and are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and are updated roughly once per day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harry James Moss</name></author><category term="coronavirus" /><category term="data science" /><category term="data analysis" /><category term="statistics" /><category term="COVIDRover" /><summary type="html">As COVID-19 continues to dominate our way of life and attention, I wanted to consider a (relatively) simple analysis comparing coronavirus cases in local areas of the UK to the level of deprivation in that area.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Exploring COVID-19 statistics and deprivation in the UK with Python - Part II</title><link href="https://harryjmoss.github.io/2020/06/30/covidrover_part2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Exploring COVID-19 statistics and deprivation in the UK with Python - Part II" /><published>2020-06-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://harryjmoss.github.io/2020/06/30/covidrover_part2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://harryjmoss.github.io/2020/06/30/covidrover_part2.html">&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve got a basic python app working, let’s look at forming this into a web app that can generate our analysis plots, update them daily and serve them up to a static site.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harry James Moss</name></author><category term="coronavirus" /><category term="data science" /><category term="data analysis" /><category term="statistics" /><category term="COVIDRover" /><summary type="html">Now we've got a basic python app working, let's look at forming this into a web app</summary></entry></feed>
