# Hello!  
I'm a Research Software Engineer (RSE) at the [British Library](https://bl.uk) working in the Digital Scholarship department to write software, support researchers and investigate (and promote!) machine learning techniques within Digital Humanities.

Previously, I have been a postdoctoral research associate at The University of Sheffield simulating the passage of cosmic-ray muons through volcanoes to determine density changes within active Colombian volcanoes. Before that, I completed a PhD in Experimental particle physics at the University of Sheffield within the supersymmetry group of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, CERN.
