<p>Training and deploying convolutional neural networks on cloud platforms to classify the orientation of the more than 7.5 million images in the British Libraryâ€™s Endangered Archives Programme</p>

<h3 id="searches-for-susy-at-the-large-hadron-collider">Searches for SUSY at the Large Hadron Collider</h3>

<p>In particular strong and third generation production searches with zero leptons and high missing transverse energy, with a focus on background estimation techniques.</p>

<h3 id="qcd-multijet-background-estimation-with-jet-smearing">QCD multijet background estimation with Jet Smearing</h3>

<p>I maintained and developed the JetSmearing software tool that provides a data-driven QCD multijet background estimate in SUSY searches with final states of zero leptons and high missing transverse energy - improving on the estimate from simulated data.</p>

<h3 id="radiation-damage-estimation-in-the-atlas-sct">Radiation damage estimation in the ATLAS SCT</h3>

<p>The ATLAS Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) is intended to be in operation until 2024. I have been involved with the ATLAS SCT working group, providing estimates of the deterioration of the silicon modules within the detector barrel due to radiation damage in the years to come. Part of the studies involved exploring differing detector cooling regimes to maximise annealing in the detector. These studies also provided an estimation of the time at which the modules would undergo type inversion. This was a task I performed throughout my PhD, alongside monitoring the noise and gain of SCT modules at regular intervals.</p>
