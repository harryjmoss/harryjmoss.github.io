I'm a Research Software Developer at UCL working in [Research IT Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/). I work with researchers to develop software to enable robust, reproducible research.

Previously, I've been a:
- Research Software Engineer (RSE) at the [British Library](https://bl.uk) working in Digital Scholarship to write software, support researchers and investigate (and promote!) machine learning techniques
- Postdoctoral Research Associate at The University of Sheffield simulating the passage of cosmic-ray muons through volcanoes to determine density changes within active Colombian volcanoes
- PhD student in Experimental particle physics at the University of Sheffield within the supersymmetry (SUSY) group of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, CERN
