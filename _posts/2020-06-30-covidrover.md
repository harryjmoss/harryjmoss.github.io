As COVID-19 continues to dominate our way of life and attention, I wanted to consider a (relatively) simple analysis comparing coronavirus cases in local areas of the UK to the level of deprivation in that area. This metric is quantified by the UK Office of National Statistics by the 'Index of Multiple Deprivation', a combined measure of several factors for a particular area considering things like available of housing, crime, barriers to housing and more.  

Coronavirus statistics for UK nations are provided by the UK government and are available [here](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) and are updated roughly once per day.
